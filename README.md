This is a Library that is meant to be used for the InfinityTools Mod for Minecraft 1.16.5. This library was created outside of the InfinityTools mod, in hopes that other modders can use some of the utilities provided in their mods, to assist their own tools.

If you'd like to add new features to the library, please open an issue before submitting a pull request.
