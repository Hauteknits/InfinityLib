# Frequently Asked Questions
#### Why did you License under the GPL instead of the LGPL?
I firmly believe in the Open Source Philosophy, and that all mods should be Open Sourced
#### Do I have to open source my Project to use this Library
No, you just have to distribute your source code along with your mod, along with licensing your mod under the GPLv3. I hope that you will allow people to improve your mod with Pull Requests, but you don't have to make any changes that you don't want.
#### What if I'm just using the library for a personal mod or a mod I never post online
Staying within the terms of the GPL, it requires that you distribute your source code and license your code under the GPLv3. If its a personal mod (you don't distribute it) then you don't have to distribute your source code (still have to license it). If you give it to a couple of friends, just give them the source code and a copy of the license.
